# SQLIFIX
SQL Injection attack is one of the oldest yet effectiveattacks  for  web  applications.  Even  in  2020,  applications  werecompromised  using  this.  The  developers  are  supposed  to  takeprecautions such as parameterizing SQL queries, escaping specialcharacters,  etc.  However,  developers,  especially  inexperiencedones,  often  fail  to  comply  with  such  guidelines.  There  are  quitea  few  SQL  Injection  detection  tools  to  expose  any  unattendedSQL  Injection  vulnerability  in  source  code.  However,  to  thebest   of   our   knowledge,   very   few   works   have   been   done   tosuggest a fix of these vulnerabilities in the source code. We havedeveloped  a  learning-based  approach  that  prepares  abstractionof  SQL  Injection  vulnerable  codes  from  training  dataset  andclusters them using hierarchical clustering. The test samples arematched  with  a  cluster  of  similar  samples  and  a  fix  suggestionis  generated.  We  have  developed  a  manually  validated  trainingand  test  dataset  from  real-world  projects  of  Java  and  PHP  toevaluate  our  language-agnostic  approach.  The  results  establishthe superiority of our technique over comparable techniques. Thecode and dataset are released publicly to encourage reproduction.
