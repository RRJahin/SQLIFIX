# SQLIFIX
SQL Injection attack is one of the oldest yet effective attacks  for  web  applications.  Even  in  2020,  applications  were compromised  using  this.  The  developers  are  supposed  to  take precautions such as parameterizing SQL queries, escaping special characters,  etc.  However,  developers,  especially  inexperienced ones,  often  fail  to  comply  with  such  guidelines.  There  are  quite a  few  SQL  Injection  detection  tools  to  expose  any  unattended SQL  Injection  vulnerability  in  source  code.  However,  to  the best of our knowledge, very few  works have been done  to suggest a fix of these vulnerabilities in the source code. We have developed  a  learning-based  approach  that  prepares  abstraction of  SQL  Injection  vulnerable  codes  from  training  dataset  and clusters them using hierarchical clustering. The test samples are matched  with  a  cluster  of  similar  samples  and  a  fix  suggestion is  generated.  We  have  developed  a  manually  validated  training and  test  dataset  from  real-world  projects  of  Java  and  PHP  to evaluate  our  language-agnostic  approach.  The  results  establish the superiority of our technique over comparable techniques. The code and dataset are released publicly to encourage reproduction.

# Output
Outputs generated by out model are given in the Output folder.
In the outputs, "Target" is the selected code segment from the input java file. It is followed by at least one or more suggestions named "suggestionX", depending on the number of suggestions found in the training dataset. 

# Sample Output
In the Sample Output folder few output files of various types are given.

# Data Set
We have two types of Train Data - Manual and Synthetic
In both cases 'Before' contains the java functions with vulnerable sql queries and 'After' contains the java functions after replacing with Prepared Statement. 
In the Test Set there is only 'Before' as we are going to generate slutions for them.
